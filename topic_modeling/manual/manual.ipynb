      "text/plain": "['The year started with a partial unwind of the market euphoria of November and December',\n 'Throughout January the US posted strong economic data',\n 'While these new inputs added further credence to the view that the US is heading for a soft landing, they also pushed back against hopes that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will need to ease monetary policy any time soon',\n 'At the end of 2023, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell had guided that rate hikes were likely behind us and the time for cuts would soon be in sight, leading to an increase in pricing of cuts at the March FOMC meeting',\n 'However, the January FOMC meeting proved more hawkish than expected with Chairman Powell indicating that a start to the cutting cycle in March was not their base case scenario',\n 'Markets unwound easing expectations accordingly and the US dollar strengthened versus peers',\n 'In emerging markets, sovereign bond issuance took off with a record start with USD 44',\n '3bn issued via primary markets in January',\n 'The record number marks the highest monthly issuance since the breakout of the Covid-19 pandemic and follows last years record January issuance',\n 'The vast majority of issuance came from investment grade credits like Saudi Arabia and Mexico, which when combined, accounted for almost 60% of total investment grade issuance',\n 'However, the most interesting deal came from high yield issuer Cote dIvoire who became the first sub-Saharan Africa sovereign issuer in almost two years',\n 'The successful placement opens the doors for other sovereigns who have been waiting in the wings to tap markets, eagerly waiting for borrowing levels to return to acceptable levels',\n 'The likes of Kenya and Angola will be keenly watched to see if they are able to issue to alleviate near term funding pressures that have built up',\n 'We will be focused on how US data evolves to understand what the US easing cycle will eventually look like and when it will begin Emerging market bonds finished the month weaker in both external and local currency markets',\n 'The JP Morgan EMBI Global Diversified Index (EMBI-GD), which tracks US dollar denominated debt, posted a -1% return',\n 'Investment grade credits were the primary driver behind the underperformance, a combination of core market repricing and large supply',\n 'High yield markets were more supported as risk appetite remained well contained given the continued equity market outperformance and the successful placement of high yield primary issuance',\n 'The JP Morgan GBI-EM Global Diversified Index (GBI-EM GD), which tracks local currency denominated debt, returned -1',\n '5% in January',\n 'The negative return was primarily driven by the FX component as strong US data and a hawkish FOMC meeting pushed the US dollar stronger versus peers',\n 'Looking forward, we will be focused on how US data evolves to understand what the US easing cycle will eventually look like and when it will begin',\n 'Across the world, politics will also come increasingly into focus',\n 'In the US, we are set for another polarizing US election, while emerging markets are set for a record number of elections',\n 'December 2023 followed a highly volatile November in which decent total returns were delivered post the core rates rally that provided significant tailwind to markets',\n 'Market participants proceeded to navigate a highly active schedule of macro data releases in December, including NFP, CPI, and the FOMC, all within the brief pre-holiday period spanning only 2',\n '5 weeks, until liquidity declined and market activity slowed',\n 'Comments from Federal Reserve Governor, Christopher Waller, indicating potential rate cuts in Q1 2024 continued to impact markets, offering additional support to global macro and EM credit',\n 'Overall, the Emso Absolute Return portfolios navigated through the December data releases well, which was largely devoid of big surprises',\n 'The bid for duration remained incredibly strong over December; by the end of the first two weeks, the IG component of the JP Morgan EMBI-Global Index returned almost 1',\n '5%, with rates accounting for two thirds of the returns and the remainder from spread compression',\n 'The year end culmination by the FOMC around mid-December resulted in a further rates rally, driving 10-year US treasury yields to 3',\n '8% as the finishing mark for the year, and substantially boosting emerging market hard currency total returns',\n 'The JP Morgan EMBI-Global Diversified Index (EMBI-GD) returned 4',\n '73% in December with both the IG and HY components bringing in almost identical return numbers of 4',\n '74% and 4',\n '72% respectively',\n 'January brought a busy month for primary market activity in EM credit with a record breaking amount of new issuance Entering the new calendar year after two outstandingly strong months was by no means going to be an easy task',\n 'Markets had not only seemed to have overshot in the macro landscape by assigning a very decent probability of rate cuts in March 2024, but there was also little room for spread compression across EM IG and the bulk of liquid BB rated credits',\n 'Further adding to these factors is the seasonality component which often sees substantial fixed income issuance across both developed and emerging markets',\n 'Within the first few days of January 2024, markets experienced a 25 basis point pullback in core rates, bringing month-to date returns into negative territory, and by 10 January the EMBI-GD Index had hit the months low at -2',\n '2%',\n 'While markets partially recovered with the rally in rates, the EMBI-GD Index failed to recover to the green, ending the month at -1',\n '02%',\n 'Assessing bond price changes for liquid EM sovereign curves in the EMBI-GD Index, we find that only distressed idiosyncratic credits were up on the month and all other benchmark curves were down',\n 'Most notably, bond prices in Ecuador and Pakistan were up around 15% and 8% respectively, on the month, however Argentina, Tunisia, Zambia, and Sri Lanka were all also curves in the green for the month of January',\n 'The Emso Absolute Return portfolios participated in four of these six stories',\n 'Considering how tight the spreads are among higher rated EM issuers, we believe that it is worth adjusting how we observe the EM fixed income universe',\n 'We find that taking the approach of selecting the highest yielding current issuers in our universe as at end of January 2024, which we view as having a greater chance of spread compression and total return gains, produces a group of countries that could potentially deliver good alpha',\n 'These countries include (in yield descending order) Pakistan, Egypt, Angola, El Salvador, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Jordan',\n 'The Emso Absolute Return portfolios have participated in all these names so far this year',\n 'January brought a busy month for primary market activity in EM credit with a record breaking amount of new issuance with multi-billion deals from Mexico, Brazil, Ecoperol in Latam, Saudi Arabia and Saudi PIF, Hungary, Romania, as well as Turkish corporates, and banks in CEEMEA',\n 'Indonesia also came to price its triple tranche bond issue on 4 January totalling USD 2',\n '05 billion, ahead of the upcoming February elections',\n 'As mentioned in this months Overview article above, there was single large and very welcomed event in January with the primary market reopening for a HY sovereign issuer in Africa after a drought of new issuance from that region for last two years',\n 'The Ivory Coast announced the tender of front-end maturities in US dollar and Euros and came with a dual tranche USD 2',\n '6 billion deal which traded extremely well on the break',\n 'We regard this as a very welcome change which should lead to greater investor confidence in prospective deals by the other issuers from the continent after years of difficulties in accessing public markets',\n 'PAKISTAN: METHOD IN THE MADNESS With Pakistan in the headlines due to its elections, we decide to review the countrys recent journey back from the brink of default and share our thoughts on the outlook',\n '2023 began with Pakistan being deeply mired in a confluence of crises: Politically, there was a high degree of turmoil with Imran Khans government being dissolved after a vote of no confidence in April 2022',\n 'His government was replaced by a fragile coalition government that faced a popular protest movement as Imran Khans supporters took to the streets',\n 'Economically, the IMF program had stalled since mid-2022 and talks between the fund and the Finance Ministry were facing an impasse on the issues of raising taxes, currency devaluation, and subsidy removal',\n 'Net FX reserves with the State Bank had whittled down to USD 3 billion, and inflation was running at 25%',\n 'Adding to this, the country was still reeling from the impact of devastating floods in August 2022',\n 'As an indicator of the high probability of default priced in by the market, by June 2023, Pakistans US dollar denominated bonds maturing in 2025 were trading at 40 cents on the dollar, which was in line with the levels that Sri Lankas defaulted debt was trading at the time',\n 'Since the start of 2023, a number of events have helped Pakistan inch back from the brink of default',\n 'Firstly, political stability improved as the army conducted a crackdown on Former Prime Minister Imran Khans party, which ultimately culminated in Imran Khan and several of his supporters being imprisoned',\n 'This removed the pressure on the government of a protest movement on the streets and also gave creditors greater visibility on who they would likely be lending to post-election',\n 'Secondly, at the end of June 2023, the IMF approved a new USD 3 billion, 9-month deal instead of simply releasing the final USD 1 billion tranche under the previous deal',\n 'This unlocked funding from other multilaterals, the GCC, and China',\n 'Finally, the elections were delayed allowing a technocratic government six months to deal with the IMF and make painful fiscal adjustments without having to worry about the political consequences',\n 'The technocratic interim government successfully concluded the first review of the IMF program in November 2023',\n 'Moreover, they have laid the ground for a new, long-term program that the incoming government can sign on to once the existing program ends in March 2024',\n 'While buffers remain thin, FX reserves at the State Bank have increased from USD 3 billion to USD 8 billion over the course of 2023',\n 'As an indicator of improved market confidence in Pakistans prospects, the aforementioned US dollar denominated bonds maturing in 2025 are now trading at 88 cents on the dollar',\n 'While the PTI will pursue legal action to contest the results, we believe that these will languish in the Pakistani court system The elections were held on 8 February 2024 on an uneven playing field with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharifs Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party as the armys preferred party',\n 'Top leadership and activists from Imran Khans Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party were imprisoned, forcing the party to field Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results',\n 'candidates as independents instead of under their party symbol; posing challenges in a country with a 42% illiteracy rate1 where many voters need to see a symbol in order to know who they are voting for',\n 'Despite the favorable set-up for the PML-N, the PTI voter turnout surprised to the upside and the elections were marred by accusations of widespread irregularities and vote fixing',\n 'While PTI-backed independents won a plurality of seats, they fell significantly short of a simple majority',\n 'After several days of deliberations, the PML-N and the center-left Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) announced that they would form a coalition government along with some smaller parties',\n 'The unwillingness of the PTI to work with the PML-N and PPP means that they are likely to sit in opposition',\n 'While the PTI will pursue legal action to contest the results, we believe that these will languish in the Pakistani court system',\n 'At the same time the political crackdown on the PTI  has reduced the risk of a protest movement spiraling out of control, and the response from the US seems to indicate that they are looking the other way',\n 'We therefore remain constructive on Pakistan over the next six months as we expect a new long-term IMF program will be signed by the incoming government While there may be concerns around the role that former Finance Minister Ishaq Dar may play in the new administration, the PML-N is a known entity with a pro-business stance',\n 'Moreover, while Pakistan has always had some degree of military influence in its politics, we believe that the army is firmly in control of the current situation at this juncture',\n 'Having undertaken a power grab over the past 12 months and then having had a technocratic government implement painful fiscal adjustments, including substantial fuel and energy hikes, we believe that the army is unlikely to let an incoming government squander those gains immediately',\n 'Although Pakistan has a long history of failed IMF programs, we believe that the government will wait until the country is out of the woods before allowing the IMF program to go off track',\n 'We therefore continue to remain constructive on Pakistan over the next six months as we expect a new long term IMF program will be signed by the incoming government which will, in turn, unlock funding from others',\n 'We expect the short-term bonds to be paid which should help support the rest of the curve, particularly given that investor positioning continues to be underweight Pakistan',\n 'Pakistans resilience in the face of default is in part explained by the institutional strength of its army that prevents the country from completely collapsing and by its geopolitical importance: the international community does not want to see a nuclear armed country of 230 million people default and fall into chaos',\n 'To go beyond resilience and actually enter a virtuous cycle that brings sustained improvement requires more wholesale political and economic reform which we have not yet seen evidence for',\n 'ESG CORNER HIGHLIGHTS OF KEY ESG ISSUES AFFECTING EMERGING MARKETS COP28 Opinions on the success or failure of COP28, formally known as the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference, vary widely, both from a regional standpoint and across the scientific community',\n 'One clear departure from previous conferences was the official acknowledgement of \"fossil fuels\" in the final text',\n 'Whether this change will prove fundamental in necessitating the urgent need to act to meet the end goal 1',\n '5C target by 2100 is yet to be seen and will continue to be debated',\n 'In this short note we summarize our key takeaways from the conference: GLOBAL STOCKTAKE COP28 concluded the first \"Global Stocktake\", a process to be repeated every five years, which was established under Article 14 of the Paris Agreement with the aim to assess collective progress in achieving the Agreement\\'s long-term goals',\n 'It involves three stages: (1) collecting data, (2) assessing initial data linked in with a technical review, and (3) political considerations',\n 'The first Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) synthesis report paints an underwhelming picture',\n 'Global temperatures are projected to rise between 2',\n '4 to 2',\n '6C, an improvement from the 3',\n '03',\n '2C estimated at the Paris Agreements',\n 'However, the report warns that the opportunity to limit warming to 1',\n '5 C is diminishing due to inadequate progress',\n 'If all current NDCs are fully implemented, global CO2 emissions would exceed the amount needed to limit global warming to 1',\n '5C by 20',\n '3-23',\n '9 gigatonnes (or 12',\n '5 to 16',\n '0 gigatonnes for a 2',\n '0C target)',\n \"The UN's 2023 Annual Emissions Gap Report reinforces that a significant amount of work is required to achieve a target of 1\",\n '5C to 2C, each requiring a reduction in 2030 global GHG emissions between 28 per cent and 42 per cent respectively',\n 'THE UAE CONSENSUS Political consideration of the output from the NDC synthesis report led to the Global Stocktake outcomes referred to as the \"UAE Consensus, which in turn should guide the next set of more ambitious NDCs',\n 'Highlights from the text are as follows:  Calls for transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner, accelerating action in this critical decade, so as to achieve net zero by 2050 in keeping with the science: this statement sparked the ongoing debate on whether it should have had a stronger phrase such as \"phase out\" to underline the commitment required to achieving the goal',\n 'We would argue that even with the watered-down term, it sets a positive direction going forwards;  Calls for tripling renewable energy capacity globally and doubling the global average annual rate of energy efficiency improvements by 2030: Also supported by a list of zero- and low-emission technologies, in addition to a Declaration to Triple Nuclear Energy',\n 'However, as the 2023 World Nuclear Industry Status Report points out, such pledges may be counterproductive',\n 'In 2022, and for the first time, China generated more energy through solar than nuclear power in 2022',\n 'Given the long lead times to build a nuclear power plant and the growing investment in renewables, the feasibility of this pledge is unknown',\n 'Recognizes that transitional fuels can play a role in facilitating the energy transition while ensuring energy security: \"Transitional fuels\" likely refers to natural gas',\n 'While some fear this could be exploited as a loophole, it could benefit countries such as Senegal in Sub-Saharan Africa, that are Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results',\n 'seeking to improve their energy security',\n 'This flexibility could help countries develop economically and transition to more efficient energy sources as defined within their economic cycle;  Calls for accelerating and substantially reducing non-carbon-dioxide emissions globally, including methane, by 2030: Given methanes potency compared to carbon dioxide and its near third contribution to current global warming, it is likely to feature in the updated NDCs as its risks become more appreciated',\n 'CARBON FINANCING AND MARKETS The continued failure of developed countries to jointly mobilize USD 100 billion was flagged with deep regret, with the text reiterating the need to meet this goal through to 2025',\n 'Based on preliminary 2022 data, it seems that this goal will be achieved for the first time',\n 'At COP28, further progress was made on the financial front',\n 'On the first day of the conference, the Loss and Damage fund was made operational, securing USD 792 million of early pledges from a number of countries',\n 'However, this is a small amount considering that estimates put financing needs nearer USD 390 billion per year to 2030, which is 50% higher than previous estimates',\n 'Additional commitments were made to the Green Climate Fund and the Adaptation Fund, and multilateral funding was also committed',\n 'One of the key agenda items for COP29, to be held in Baku, Azerbaijan, will be the agreement of a New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) to be agreed before 2025, with a floor of USD 100 billion per year, aiming to take into account the needs and priorities of developing countries',\n 'Carbon markets are also set to feature, as progress on operationalizing Article 6 of the Paris Agreement has stalled',\n 'OUR TAKEAWAYS While the UAE Consensus showed that diplomacy across many various views and interests works, key issues continue to stand out, particularly, the urgent need for financing, the timescale for the transition, and more importantly, political will',\n 'Aside from the latter, which could be negatively impacted by the huge election calendar that we have entered and potential detrimental changes in climate policies as a result, the key issue is time and concerns of delaying action',\n 'Climate risks continue to increase for vulnerable Emerging Market countries and as a result, while COP28 did make some headways across the board, it is imperative that sovereigns pursue and push their own agenda to finely balance economic growth and the move to more renewable technologies',\n 'Following the shock of Covid-19, increasing inflationary pressures, and supply shocks due to the Russo-Ukrainian war, vulnerable EMs public finances have been placed under further strain, and with it the rollout of policies with relation to mitigation and adaptation',\n 'To highlight an example of the risks countries face, the 2023 AfDB African Economic Performance and Outlook report claims that such shocks have pushed 15 million more Africans into extreme poverty, adding to adaptation pressures',\n 'As noted in our recent white paper Revisiting the case for Emerging Markets, \"countries are diverse, with varying growth paths, policies, vulnerabilities, and ultimately, performance',\n 'Treating them uniformly risks overlooking this diversity',\n 'While developed nations are eager to phase out or down fossil fuels, many EM countries are at different economic life cycles',\n 'A forced transition to a renewable framework could be detrimental to their economic development given the financing and support that is required, which is currently nowhere close to being met',\n 'We live in an environment where global supply chains are established',\n 'We believe that we should make use of them, allowing EM countries to embrace fossil fuels in a less carbon-intensive manner - supporting their developmental goals, while also investing in supporting a push to expand their renewable footprint in which a nation has a competitive advantage',\n 'Continued support for disaster resilience should be encouraged, as sovereign states can be slow to improve their own mitigation measures, whether it is due to political will or funding gaps',\n 'This also goes hand-in-hand with continued sovereign engagement to ensure sustainability commitments are not just declarations on paper',\n 'Finally, we note that ESG benchmarks need to be careful in how they ascertain the progress that a sovereign has made towards decarbonizing',\n 'This could result in an unfair treatment of a sovereigns index weight, which could again, preclude them from much-needed financing',\n '']"
